!Options for MSED CMFD Solver in MPACT.
! - MSED can provide a substantial reduction in CMFD run time
! - Depending on the PETSc version it may incur some
!   additional memory usage
! - The method performs better on larger problems
! - MSED is not necessarily robust for HFP depletion
!   (use MSEDL instead).
